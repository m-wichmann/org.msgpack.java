MsgPack Java
============

This is a repackaging of the MessagePack library for Java as a Eclipse Plugin.
I can't take any credit for any Code in this repo!
See https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-java for details.

This Eclipse plugin is a requirement for the MsgPackEditor plugin that can be
found under https://github.com/m-wichmann/org.freenono.msgpack
